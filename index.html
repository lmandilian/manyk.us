        <h1><strong>MANYK</strong> | <em>manic</em> |</h1>

<p>MANYK is the name for the collaboration between video artist, Lauren Mandilian and choreographer, David Konyk. MANYK incorporates the living body and video together when the desired effect cannot be created any other way. We strive to make technology seamless; to sometimes trick and surprise, understanding these illusions come together more genuinely when the humanity is kept intact.</p>
